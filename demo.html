    <!--File Path Examples
    
        Path                        Description
        <ima src="picture.jpg"      The "picture.jpg" file is located in the 
                                    same folder as the current page

        <img src="images/picture.jpg"> The "picture.jpg" file is located in the
                                        images folder in the current folder
                                        
        <img src="/images/picture.jpg"> The "picture.jpg" file is located in the
                                        images folder at the root of the
                                        current web
        
        <img src="../picture.jpg"> The "picture.jpg" file is located in the
                                    folder one level upnfrom the current
                                    folder
    -->

    <!--HTML File Paths
    
        A file path describes the location of a file in a web site's folder structure.

        File paths are used when linking to external files, like:

        . Web pages
        . Images
        . Style sheets
        . JavaScript
    -->

    <!-- 
        <img src="https://www.google.com/images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain">
    -->

<!--Relative File Paths

    A relative file path points to a file relative to the current page.

    In the following example, the file path points to a file in the images folder
    located at the root of the current web:

        <img src="/imgages/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain">

    In the following example, the file path points to a file in the images folder
    located in the current folder:

    Example:
        <img src="images/picture.jpg alt="Mountain">

    In the following example, the file path points to a file in the images folder
    located in the folder one level up from the current folder:

    Example:
        <img src="../images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain">

<!--Best Practice

    It is best practice to use relative file paths (if possible).

    When using relative file paths, your web pages will not be bound to your
    current base URL. All links will work on your own computer (locahost) as
    well as on your current public domain and your future public domains.
